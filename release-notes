## 2019-01-31, Version 1.0.0 (Current)

### New Features

This is the first release of the Open Distro Performance Analyzer.

Performance Analyzer has two components:
Performance Analyzer Plugin: Collects metrics across the stack and writes them to shared memory. As this is the plug-in, this will run within the Elasticsearch process.
Performance Analyzer Agent: A Java process that takes periodic snapshots of metrics collected by Plugin, and indexes them to provide a REST interface. The interface supports aggregations on metrics grouped by dimensions for a given time interval. More details of supported metrics, aggregations and dimensions can be found in the documentation.

### Commits
